              <p>
                Quotes are provided free of charge and are based on the information you give us
                about the site and the work required. If the actual scope differs materially from
                what was described, we may revise the quote before or during the job. A booking is
                confirmed once we have agreed the scope, price and schedule with you.

                <li>Invoices are payable by the due date stated on the invoice.</li>
                <li>
                  For ongoing services, pricing may be reviewed periodically with reasonable
                  notice to you.

              <p>
                We operate without lock-in contracts. You may start, pause or cancel ongoing
                services by giving us reasonable notice, as agreed at the time of booking.

              <p>
                We ask for at least 24 hours&apos; notice to cancel or reschedule a booked clean.
                Cancellations made with less notice, or where our team is unable to access the
                site at the agreed time, may incur a fee to cover the reserved labour.

                You agree to provide safe and timely access to the site and to advise us of any
                hazards, security requirements or special instructions. We are not responsible for

                conditions beyond our control.

              <p>
                If you are not satisfied with a clean, let us know within 24 hours and we will
                return to re-clean the affected areas at no additional cost. This guarantee covers

              <p>
                We carry public liability insurance and our staff are police-checked. To the
                extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to re-performing the services or
                the cost of having the services re-performed. Nothing in these terms excludes any
                rights you have under the Australian Consumer Law.

                Any claim for loss or damage must be reported to us in writing within 48 hours of
                the service so we can investigate promptly. We are not liable for pre-existing
                damage or for items that are inherently fragile and were not disclosed to us.
